    "description": "This module helps to test your flow. Testcases are written in flow-asserter in node and flow-asserter out node is inserted into flow at the point wanted to assert msg.payload. Each testcase sends a message from the upper output port of flow-asserter in node. When the message reaches flow-asserter out node, msg.payload is compared with testcase's output and result of that comparison is sent from the lower output port of flow-asserter in node. If test is not run, flow-asserter out node simply hand over the message to next node.",
